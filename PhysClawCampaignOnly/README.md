*CampaignOnly note: This filter should only be used for races/speedruns to A10 or earlier. Don't use it if you plan on mapping.*

*Version note: This filter is for 3.22. There are no plans for it to be updated for 3.23 leaguestart, and it shouldn't be used for leaguestarting anyways.*

# About this filter:

This filter is for phys claw builds. It's perfectly usable for A5 runs, but is tailored more towards A10. 

Weapons focused on: 
- All melee weapons until Prisoner's Gate
- Any melee weapons that can be used with Whirling Blades from Prisoner's Gate to mid A2
- Claws from mid A2 onwards

You can also use this filter for ele claws, but it will be slightly suboptimal. Namely, rare claws that have "fallen behind the phys curve" (e.g. a rare Awl in A6) won't play TTS.
