*CampaignOnly note: This filter should only be used for races/speedruns to A10 or earlier. Don't use it if you plan on mapping.*

*Version note: This filter is for 3.22. There are no plans for it to be updated for 3.23 leaguestart, and it shouldn't be used for leaguestarting anyways.*

# About this filter:

This filter serves as a starting point for all CampaignOnly filters, dictating the progression of basic items like currency, jewellery, and flasks.

You could, in theory, level any build with this filter because every rare is highlighted equally. However, I'd highly recommend against using it because you won't see any base types tailored towards your build.
