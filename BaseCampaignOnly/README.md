# About this filter

*CampaignOnly note: This filter should only be used for races/speedruns to A10 or earlier. Don't use this filter if you plan on mapping.*

This filter serves as a starting point for all CampaignOnly filters, dictating the progression of basic items like currency, jewellery, and flasks.

You could, in theory, level any build with this filter because every rare is highlighted equally. However, I'd highly recommend against using this filter because you won't see any base types tailored towards your build.
