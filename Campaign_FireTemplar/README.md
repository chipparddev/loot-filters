*Campaign note: This filter should only be used for races/speedruns to A10 or earlier. Don't use it if you plan on mapping.*

*Version note: This filter is for 3.22. There are no plans for it to be updated for 3.23 leaguestart, and it shouldn't be used for leaguestarting anyways.*

# About this filter:

This filter is for the templar fire caster build that uses Rolling Magma, Armageddon Brand, and Cremation. It's perfectly usable for A5 runs, but is tailored more towards A10.

Only use this filter if you're going dual wield Leap Slam to A10, as it doesn't highlight shields with good links. I may make an alternate version that supports a swap to Shield Charge in the future.
