# Welcome to the Chippard Filter Emporium

All filters in this repository are fully documented. In the documentation, groupings of items will follow this format:

Description of the item grouping
- Area levels
> - Appearance
> - Size
> - Sound
> - Map icon 

If the item grouping doesn't have sound and doesn't have a map icon, the last two rows will be omitted.
