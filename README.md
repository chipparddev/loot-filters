# Welcome to Chippard's loot filter emporium

Please read the README.md associated with the filter that you want to download before using it.

All filters in this repository are fully documented. In the documentation, groupings of items will follow this format:

- Description of the item grouping
> - Appearance
> - Size
> - TTS 
> - Map icon 

If the item grouping doesn't have TTS or a map icon, the last two rows will be omitted.
