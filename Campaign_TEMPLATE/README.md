*Campaign note: This filter should only be used for races/speedruns to A10 or earlier. Don't use it if you plan on mapping.*

*Version note: This filter is for 3.22. There are no plans for it to be updated for 3.23 leaguestart, and it shouldn't be used for leaguestarting anyways.*

# About this filter:

This filter serves as a starting point for all of the campaign filters, laying out the groundwork for the progression of things like jewellery, flasks, and currency. 

This filter is strictly a tool and isn't intended for actual gameplay. If you use it, you won't see links or bases tailored towards your build.
