# About this filter:

This filter serves as a starting point for all of the campaign filters, dictating the progression of general items such as jewellery, flasks, and currency. 

This filter is strictly a tool and isn't intended for actual gameplay. If you use it, you won't see links or bases tailored towards your build.
